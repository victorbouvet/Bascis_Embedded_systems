#### 6 pratictal work of 4 hours

## Session 1 : Input/Output ports (GPIO) and external interrupt
  - First codes in C for the 8051F020 in the Microvision4 environment 
  - Implementation of the 8051F020DK board 
  - Configuration and use of the GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) 
  - Implementation of an interrupt in C 
## Session 2 : Timers and Interruptions
- Review of the concepts discussed during the last course (I/O ports)
- Implementation of external and internal interrupts
- Configuration and basic use of timers
## Session 3 : Crossbar - Oscillator - Timers
- Route device signals through the interconnect matrix
- Configure the system clock
- Use timers in counter mode
## Session 4 : Serial transmission - UART
- Learn how to configure and use the UART device to exchange information with a remote system (a
PC)
## Session 5: ADC - DAC
- Learn to configure and use analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion devices
## Session 6: Synthesis - Code structuring
- Work on code structuring - Cohabitation of several applications on the same processor
